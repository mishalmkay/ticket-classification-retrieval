End-to-End Pipeline

Developed a Python pipeline that:

Preprocesses a new incoming ticket

Predicts its type using the trained classifier

Retrieves the top-k most similar historical tickets from Supabase

Saves the new ticket into the database for future retrieval

keep this on top so people can see what you actually build
